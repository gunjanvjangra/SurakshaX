SurakshaX addresses key issues in disaster preparedness in India, a country prone to crises like earthquakes, floods, and cyclones. Despite frequent disasters, public awareness and readiness remain low, leading to loss of lives and delayed responses. SurakshaX aims to change this by providing an interactive, engaging platform to help individuals and communities learn how to effectively respond to emergencies. The platform tackles the lack of awareness and preparedness by offering interactive learning modules, quizzes, and real-world scenarios that simplify disaster response. This makes learning accessible and easier to understand, ensuring individuals are better prepared. SurakshaX also uses gamification to keep users engaged, enhancing retention of critical safety skills, which is especially useful in schools.

SurakshaX benefits not only individuals but also schools, NGOs, and government agencies. It can be integrated into educational curricula, used by community organizations for awareness, and partnered with government agencies for national disaster preparedness initiatives.
Ultimately, SurakshaX creates a more resilient, disaster-ready society by making disaster preparedness easier, safer, and more effective through interactive learning and real-time community support.
